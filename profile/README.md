# How to Find an Expired Domains with High Domain Authority

Like any powerful SEO tool, this needs to be used right, and that means working with expired domains. A well-chosen expired domain with high domain authority (DA) can provide the immediate advantage in rankings, backlinks, and traffic. However, not every expired domain is valuable- many might be tainted with bad link histories or have zero authority.

Step-by-step, this article will show how you can find those expired domains that still carry value from an SEO stance and what factors you must consider before throwing your money on them.

## Why Expired Domains Matter for SEO

After a domain expires, its SEO power decreases in no time. If this expired domain had a solid past with great backlinks and reputation, such signals might even accrue to the benefit of the new owner. By acquiring such domains, you can:

- **Leverage backlinks:** Upon expiration, the domain might already have backlinks coming from a few established websites. This means that time need not be wasted building links: A handful of quality backlinks from a few authority sites might be worth more than hundreds of new ones.
- **Boost authority:** Domains with high DA scores are scored higher in search rankings because they carry the authority signals through domain inheritance. Hence, a site would automatically take a few steps in SEO compared to setting it up on a rather new domain.
- **Rebuild or redirect traffic:** Some expired domains are still getting traffic through residual backlinks or direct traffic, wherein you can either rebuild the old site for that audience or redirect it toward your primary site strategically.
- **Get a head start:** Aside from waiting for months or even years to build credibility, expired domains with history let you instantly inherit authority wherein your new project can be fast-tracked towards [being indexed](https://www.accuindexcheck.com/) and ranked.

## Step 1: Tap Into Expired Domain Marketplaces

A good place to start would be to consider marketplaces that openly sell expired or auctioned domains; at these platforms, information is made available about DA, backlinks, age, and traffic.

- **GoDaddy Auctions:** This is one of the largest and most popular marketplaces for bidding on expired domains. It offers thousands of listings on domains for different niches every day, which are easy to filter for authority domains. GoDaddy being such a trusted name, you can get a range of options from premium to affordable ones.
- **NameJet & SnapNames:** The platforms deal mostly with premium expired domains and usually auction "pending delete" names before they hit the public. They are known to have higher quality listings; the competition can be tougher. Certainly, if you are after powerful aged domains, you should be checking these regularly.
- **ExpiredDomains.net:** Consider the free platform that boasts a myriad of great features, where domains could be filtered by DA, backlinks, TLDs, traffic, and even niche keywords. It is perfect for sorting very large lists to zero-in on only the most relevant domains that are SEO-friendly.
- **Flippa:** Flippa is a domain name marketplace, and it also deals in expired domains and provides information on SEO stats like backlinks, the age of the expired domain name, and traffic to the expired domain names. You will often find odd opportunities here, putting domains that may have traffic or monetization history.

## Step 2: Filter by Domain Authority

Domain Authority, a metric by Moz, is a powerful choice to list whether the expired domain is worth being considered. Usually, a higher DA suggests that the domain had strong backlinks and recognition.

While filtering expired domains:

- **Look for DA 20+:** Domains with DA above 20 usually contribute visible SEO benefit to someone. Anything below might not benefit the nomenclature unless niche relevance or special backlink is at stake.
- **Check DR (Domain Rating) & TF (Trust Flow):** Tools like Ahrefs and Majestic offer quality checks for the backlinks. DR is basically an overall score of the strength of the backlink profile, while TF actually checks how trustworthy the links are. One must check both to make sure that the numbers are not being inflated.
- **Avoid sudden spikes:** If a domain's DA looks suspiciously high compared to the DA from some two or three months back, it could well be that that domain DA has been raised through spammy link building. Hence, one must consider an in-depth backlink audit before going for the purchase.

## Step 3: Analyze the Backlink Profile

Backlink Profile means nothing if it's toxic. Check the following before purchasing:

- **Referring Domains:** The number should be healthy, with unique and authoritative sites linking back to the domain. The domain with hundreds of low-quality links and none with strong referring domains is of little value.
- **Link Quality:** Links from news sites, educational (.edu), or government (.gov) websites are highly trustworthy and stand with heavy SEO weight.
- **Anchor Text:** Separate from stuffing keywords, an anchor text can get pumped up with a load of irrelevant phrases-almost a surefire way of spotting a spam. Balanced and natural anchors are safer.
- **Link Relevance:** A domain related to "technology" should ideally have backlinks coming from tech blogs, review sites, or industries related thereto. Irrelevant backlinks reduce long-term SEO value.

## Step 4: Check Domain History

The past of a domain can hint at either legitimate activation or use within spammy networks. Use the following:

- **Wayback Machine:** Archive.org offers a mechanism to view the historical snapshots of how the site was. The site ought to be avoided should it have been redolent of irrelevant, spammy, or hateful content.
- **WHOIS History:** Check past ownership records. Domains that have changed ownerships frequently in a short time period could be spam.
- **Google Ban Check:** Just search site:domain.com on Google. If no results appear, this domain may have been deindexed or banned.

## Step 5: Evaluate Traffic Metrics

Sometimes a domain can have a considerable DA of, say, 50+, but very little actual traffic. SEO value bodes well if and when the domain is still receiving visitors.

- **Organic Traffic:** Use SEMrush or Ahrefs to check for keyword rankings of a domain. Domains are more valuable if they have steady organic traffic.
- **Geographic Traffic:** See where the traffic is coming from. If you are targeting the US market while almost all the traffic visit the site from unrelated regions, the SEO value may be limited.
- **Traffic Trends:** A domain with steady and growing traffic is the best pick. Traffic falling off by and large could indicate penalties or loss of relevance.

## Step 6: Avoid Spammy Expired Domains

The biggest batch, expired domains, is sold off because these domains have lost their SEO value as a result of spam or penalties. Avoid:

- **Domains with spammy backlinks:** Links from link farms, automated blog comments, or irrelevant directories lower SEO trust.
- **Domains with irrelevant anchors:** Backlinks with random foreign language phrases are another red flag.
- **Domains tied to black-hat SEO or PBNs:** These types often carry penalties that are often hard to bounce back from.
- **Domains penalized by Google:** Check Google Search Console (after purchase) for status.

- **Rebuild old content:** Restore popular pages from the domain's history to preserve the linkages of the backlink after they are set up. It maintains the link equity and keeps external sites pointing toward you. Use archive tools just to resuscitate the most valuable pages.
